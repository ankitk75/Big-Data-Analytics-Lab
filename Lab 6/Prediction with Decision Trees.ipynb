    "Prediction using decision trees involves utilizing a decision tree algorithm to make informed predictions or classifications based on input features. Decision trees are hierarchical structures that recursively split data into subsets, guided by feature attributes, to ultimately reach a decision or prediction at the tree's leaves. The algorithm learns from training data, where it identifies optimal feature splits to create a tree that best captures patterns and relationships within the dataset. In predictive modeling, decision trees are employed for tasks such as classification or regression. For classification, the tree assigns instances to predefined categories, while in regression, it predicts numerical values. Decision trees are interpretable and effective in handling complex relationships, making them valuable in various domains such as finance, healthcare, and marketing for making accurate predictions and aiding decision-making processes.\n",

    "Lab Exercises:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Demonstrate how to load a dataset suitable for prediction into a PySpark DataFrame and Display basic statistics and information about the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Implement a PySpark script to handle missing values and categorical features in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Develop a PySpark script that trains a decision tree model on the training dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Implement code to evaluate the decision tree model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall."
